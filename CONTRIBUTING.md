## How Can I Contribute?

At the moment the 2 main ways to contribute are via Bug reports and Feature requests. We are also open to code contributions however as of yet no guidelines are prepared.

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report :pencil:, reproduce the behaviour :computer: :computer:, and find related reports :mag_right:.

 Fill in [the template](https://github.com/cemac/CALiPr/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D)<!-- LINK TO ISSUE TAB IN REPO -->.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, start with your conda environment or RStudio version.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. You can link to a script or provide snippets of code the issue, using [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behaviour you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behaviour.
* **Explain which behaviour you expected to see instead and why.**

Provide more context by answering these questions:

* **Did the problem start happening recently** I.e. is this only in the latest version
* **If the problem started happening recently,** can you reproduce the problem in an older version on [the releases page](https://github.com/cemac/CALiPr/releases)?<!-- LINK TO RELEASE TAB IN REPO-->
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.
* **Is the problem related to a certain set of data?**

Include details about your configuration and environment:

* **Which version of R are you using?** You can get the exact version by running `version` in the RStudio console.
* **What's the name and version of the OS you're using**? We highly recommend using a UNIX system with a conda environment determined by the `CALiPr.yml` file included in this repository

### Feature Requests

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for the Storm Scripts module, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion :pencil: and find related suggestions :mag_right:.

When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please include as many details as possible. Fill in [the template](https://github.com/cemac/CALiPr/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=%5BFEATURE+REQUEST%5D), including the steps that you imagine you would take if the feature you're requesting existed.

#### Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion

* **Check a functions help**, using `?` in the R console, for example for help with the leaflet funcion use `?leaflet`
* **Perform a cursory search to see if the enhancement has already been suggested.** If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Create an issue on that repository and provide the following information:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include copy/paste-able snippets which you use in those examples, as [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the current behaviour** and **explain which behaviour you expected to see instead** and why.
* **Explain why this enhancement would be useful to other users**
* **Specify the name and version of the OS you're using.** <!-- Typically we'll recommend UNIX -->
