# Data Exploration Shiny App

This repository contains an app for the exploration of Farm Survey data for the project "Optimising Crop Residuals for Conservation Agriculture and Livestock Production in Malawi", or "Malawi-CALiPr". 

The app is written using Shiny, a GUI creator for R, and is run through RStudio. It uses as inputs the csv and shape files included in this repository, which should be kept in the same folder as the R script files.

Further documentation will be included in the wiki for this repository.
